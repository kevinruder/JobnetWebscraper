[Department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences University of Copenhagen   A two-year Postdoc position is available in the bioinformatics group (http://ivh.ku.dk/bioinformatics), Center for non-coding RNA in Technology and Health (RTH), (http://rth.dk) at Department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences at University of Copenhagen. The Postdoc position in Bioinformatics and Neurotranscriptomics is available from 15 April 2018 or as soon as possible thereafter.      Information about the department can be found at http://ivh.ku.dk/english/.      You will be a team player working with great excitement, and a key person in the project essential for obtaining successful results. The Postdoc position is part of the Indo-Danish NeuroStem project, which aims to discover RNA mediated regulation in neurodegeneration through stem cell models. The Postdoc will be interacting closely with the Group for Stem Cells and Embryology. See http://neurostem.dk for details. The Neurostem project is supported by Innovation Fund Denmark.      Background   The NeuroStem project aims at identifying and manipulating non-coding RNA to obtain novel functional insight in Alzheimer´s and Parkinson’s diseases that can enable improved treatment. The non-coding RNAs will be extracted from expression experiments of patient-specific neuronal cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells obtained from skin fibroblasts. Further details can be found at http://neurostem.dk.      Job description The project involves detection and analysis of non-coding and structured RNA and their correlation of transcriptomic data in regards to the neurodegenerative diseases. Relevant methods will be employed for the transcriptome analysis and methods for detecting structured RNA and RNA-RNA interactions will be developed and incorporated in the integrated pipelines. There will be close synergy to the experimental side in e.g. the set up for mechanistic experiments to further verify RNA functions in relation to neurodegeneration.    Required qualifications and selection criteria The applicant should hold the professional as well as personal skills and qualifications as stated below:    A completed PhD degree in bioinformatics, computer science or in a similar area       General background knowledge of biological areas of genome structure and transcriptomes       Algorithmic insight broad and for RNA 2D structure       Strong experience with script languages such as Perl or Python (or similar)       Strong experience with the Linux/Unix environment, command lines and shell scripting       Solid experience with transcriptome analysis       Familiarity or experience in at least one of the following programming languages: C, C++ or Java       Good interpersonal skills       Excellent in English both in writing and speech   Candidates fulfilling one or more of the following qualifications will be prioritised:    Experience with transcriptomic data from neurodegenerative diseases       Strong experience in at least one of the following programming languages: C, C++ or Java   It is recommended that the applicant address the qualification requirements one by one in the cover letter.      Terms of employment Salary and other terms and conditions of appointment are set in accordance with the Agreement between the Ministry of Finance and AC (Danish Confederation of Professional Associations) or other relevant professional organisations. The position is covered by the “Memorandum on Job Structure for Academic Staff at the Universities” of June 28, 2013.      The gross basic salary range for Postdoctoral Fellows is DKK 33,224 to DKK 34,980 per month (level 6 to 8). To the basic salary a supplement could be negotiated, dependent on the candidate’s experience and qualifications. An additional 17.1 % monthly contribution to pension will be paid by the employer. Non-Danish and Danish applicants may be eligible for tax reductions, if they hold a PhD degree and have not lived in Denmark for the last 10 years.      The position is limited to a two-year period.      Place of employment RTH is located on Frederiksberg Campus; however, as part of the NeuroStem project research visits to project partners will be a part of the Postdoc employment. Our research environment is highly international and stimulating. We frequently organise seminars, workshops, PhD summer schools with international speakers and have retreats with our international collaborators.      Questions  For further information about the scientific content of the position please contact Professor Jan Gorodkin, email gorodkin@sund.ku.dk, phone +45 2337 5667 or for application procedure and formalities please contact HR Officer Marie-Louise Rosenlund, email mlr@sund.ku.dk, phone: +45 353 32898.      Application procedure Apply by clicking "Apply online" below.

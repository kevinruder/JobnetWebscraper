[The Department of Bio and Health Informatics at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU Bioinformatics) has its main research and teaching activities in bio-medical and bio-technological informatics, metagenomics, epidemiology, quantitative genomics, integrative systems biology and machine learning. The research involves the use of vast amount of phenotypic, clinical, environmental, biological, biotechnological and multi-omic information in humans, animals, plants and microbes. We run projects combining big data and laboratory research via the national supercomputing center or Computerome and the molecular biology/genomics laboratories.
The department is seeking an associate professor in the field of metagenomics and bioinformatics with a focus on the human and animal microbiome. The research at DTU Bioinformatics is focused on quantitative, bioinformatics and computational analyses of new data and data types being generated within biological, biomedical, clinical, and biotechnological and life sciences area. It strives to gain new knowledge, drive innovation in human and animal sciences and technology, and collaborate with all relevant industries. A cornerstone in achieving this is the dedicated effort within DTU Bioinformatics to develop bioinformatics, quantitative genomics, immuno-informatics, metagenomics and systems biology methods and solutions to the challenge of handling and interpreting large scale and heterogeneous big data. The department consists of seven research groups and two core infrastructures (DMAC and access to Computerome). The department’s research is centered on the following areas:
1. Health Genomics and immuno-informatics2. Quantitative & Systems Genomics, Bioinformatics, Integrative Omics Data Analyses3. Machine learning in Life and Medical Sciences
Responsibilities and tasks

The applicant should be able to document a strong profile for research, education and external collaborations in human/animal metagenomics and bioinformatics including expertise in high performance computing in life / medical sciences.
The candidate must actively take part in the development of bachelor and master courses and teach within the field of metagenomics and bioinformatics.
The candidate must actively develop and run research projects or programs and actively seek external funding from national, EU and international funding bodies in human/animal metagenomics and related areas.
The candidate will closely collaborate with the quantitative & systems genomics group in the area of microbiome systems biology/genomics.
Supervise and/or co-supervise master and PhD students and mentor postdocs and assistant professors, in his/her area of expertise and perform academic assessment work.
Dissemination of research results at all levels including publications of research in high impact journals.
Establish and strengthen collaboration with national and international groups working in the above areas.
Continued interaction with peers from relevant departments and centers at DTU and from other national and international research groups.
Qualifications

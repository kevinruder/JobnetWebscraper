[We are Microsoft’s Customer & Field Advocacy team (CFA)—a global network within the Customer & Partner Advocacy (CPA) organization, focused on advocating for Microsoft customers and partners. Unique within Microsoft, the CFA organization facilitates resolution of customer and partner related issues by connecting the field with experts and key decision makers within the company.
CFA manages the GetHelp support service - a strategic, field-focused, holistic escalation service.   This GetHelp service resolves customer and partner issues that lack support through normal support channels. CFA/GetHelp is also tightly aligned with the OneList escalation service (a company-wide resource dedicated to solving systemic issues that compromise revenue, usage, and/or satisfaction). 
CFA is a global organization delivered through FTE’s, contingent and vendor staff aligned to local subsidiaries. GetHelp allows Microsoft to proactively listen and respond to customer, partner, and field issues via the GetHelp Portal, and capture, track and drive the resolution of systemic issues via OneList. As a key resource for Microsoft employees and partners, GetHelp provides a mechanism to address individual customer issues and identify systemic problems that impact our customers and partners. The CFA goal is simple:   We advocate for our customers to make Microsoft better.   Every day!
Microsoft’s Customer & Field Advocacy team has an exciting and challenging role as a Senior Advocacy Manager in Denmark.

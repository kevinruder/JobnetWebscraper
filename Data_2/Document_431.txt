Its scientific staff consists of around 20 tenured full and associate professors, more than ten assistant professors and post-doctoral fellows, and a cohort of between 30 and 40 PhD students. More than 500 Bachelor’s and Master’s students are enrolled in the department’s teaching programmes. The department has a strong international profile, attracting visiting researchers, fellows and students from across the world. The department is thus very much a site of emergent research and upcoming talent, and the new professor(s) will be expected to engage with and lead initiatives involving and catering for junior scholars.The department’s research profile is extremely broad, focusing on core anthropological problems and issues in all varieties of human societies and social settings. Regionally, the department’s expertise extends throughout most geographical areas of the world. Its researchers are engaged on all continents, although the department’s traditional strengths in Southern and South-East Asia, as well as in Eastern and Southern Africa, are still visible – combined with a strong ethnographic commitment to Denmark and Danish society. Thematically, the department is no less diverse, with a history of research clusters within the anthropology of politics, religion, modernity and medicine having been reinforced, in recent years, by new research foci such as land and border conflicts, migration and mobility, urbanism and planning, environmental and multi-species ethnography, heritage and memory, as well as visual anthropology and new experimental methodologies.The department’s teaching programmes offer first-rate training in theory, data collection and analysis combined with a strong emphasis on learning through fieldwork practice and other ways of engaging with the world, including corporate and governmental contexts. We offer Bachelor’s and Master’s degree programmes in anthropology as well as an interdisciplinary, English-language Master’s programme in human security, supplementary (minor) programmes in anthropology and sociology for graduates of other Bachelor’s degree programmes, and a Danish-language, part-time Master’s degree programme in health anthropology designed for healthcare professionals. As part of their Master’s degree programme in anthropology, students choose a track specialisation in general, visual or medical anthropology, preparing them for field studies and thesis writing within these areas. Likewise, our human security students engage with international partners such as NGOs in analysing and addressing real-life challenges across the globe. Our close relationship with the adjacent Moesgaard Museum and its staff – some of whom hold positions shared between the university and the museum – provides students with opportunities for creating exhibitions or otherwise engaging in research communication with the general public. We include graduate students in the department’s research activities and seminars, for instance by inviting them to conduct fieldwork and write their theses in relation to large, ongoing projects.The School of Culture and SocietyAt the School of Culture and Society, the object of research and teaching is the interplay between culture and society in time and space:

From the traditional disciplines of the humanities and theology to applied social research
From Antiquity to the issues facing contemporary societies
From familiar Danish cultural forms to other very different worlds
From local questions to global challengesThe school’s ambition is to produce compelling research with an international resonance, as well as offering teaching and talent development of the highest quality. The school has a broad cooperative interface with society as a whole, both in Denmark and abroad, and contributes to social innovation, research communication and further and continuing education.For more details about the school, please see http://cas.au.dk/en/ (http://cas.au.dk/en/).Deadline: 1 May 2018.Qualification requirementsApplicants should hold a PhD or equivalent academic qualifications.Formalities

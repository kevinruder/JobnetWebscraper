[The Department of Management at Aarhus BSS, Aarhus University, invites applications for a 1 1/2-year postdoctoral position offering an exciting opportunity to join three related projects on market practices in relation to local food products and animal welfare.The starting date is 1 July 2018 or subject to mutual agreement.The research projectsThe position will involve working on three research projects focused on market practices in the food sector; “Provenance”, “Demand Driven Innovation for Higher Quality Beef and Lamb” and “Value Creation in Danish Pig Production through Increased Focus on Animal Welfare.”The Provenance project is financed by the Danish Innovation Fund. It addresses the knowledge gaps that exist related to physical, cultural and economic factors that prevent the growth of the Danish provenance food sector. To address these gaps, the successful candidate will conduct detailed case studies of both successful and unsuccessful cases of provenance foods in order to determine facilitators and barriers to farmers, processors, food service operators and retailers for successfully engaging in activities related to developing and marketing provenance foods. The project will employ a practice perspective to investigate how local producers can develop sustainable business models and market strategies for producing, processing and distributing provenance foods.The second project is financed by Interreg Öresund-Kattegat-Skagerrak and aims to contribute to more innovative techniques and methods that will provide primacy producers and other value chain stakeholders with opportunities for meeting the demands of different groups of customers regarding ethical and eating quality in order to strengthen their competitiveness on both the domestic and international market. More specifically, the successful candidate will study how animal welfare aspects influence different stakeholders’ perception of quality, and how market practices and collaborative practices further or hinder firms from engaging in the development and marketing of products with a better animal welfare.The third project is financed by Svineafgiftsfonden. The purpose is to explore the possibilities for developing Danish indoor production of pork sold under an animal welfare label. Specifically, the candidate will help study the representations that retailers and other relevant stakeholders have of the market for animal welfare and the expectations about how the market will develop.Job descriptionThe successful candidate is expected to contribute to the overall objectives of the projects by being involved in the data collection (interviews in Danish and international companies and organisations) as well as the other phases of the research process, including coordination of research activities, analysis and interpretation of data, writing of scientific articles, dissemination of results to practitioner and the ongoing development of the projects.The position is research-oriented but will involve teaching assignments (210 hours/year). This means that the successful candidate is expected to provide a dedicated contribution to both the department’s research and teaching environment.Qualifications Candidates must hold a PhD relevant to the academic areas of the Department of Management, preferably within one or more of the following areas: temporality, systems theory, inter-organisational relationships, value mediation and qualitative methods.The successful candidate will demonstrate a high level of English skills.

[Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability (DTU Biosustain) in Kongens Lyngby, close to Copenhagen, is establishing a scale-up/-down piloting facility to commercialize bio-based products and molecules for a variety of customers and application markets. The work of the Piloting Facility of the Center aims towards bridging the gap between academic metabolic engineering projects from cell factories and their commercial application. We aim at establishment and integration of a whole workflow, from synthetic biology through genetic engineering, bench-scale fermentations and scale-up process design towards gate milestone driven project and process development until successful release into the market.To achieve that, we are using state-of-the-art technology, equipment and tools and seek fellow mindsets for open, creative, collaborative and interdisciplinary approaches. In order to accelerate time to market for the several organisms and cell hosts and their respective downstream processes, we intend to further strengthen the Centers already existing capabilities by adding a highly motivated team of Engineers, Scientists and Technicians to tackle this challenging task. An open mind for different disciplines in natural sciences and engineering is wanted, in order to learn the most of each other and create the critical synergies to be successful.If you identify yourself with such a mindset, are interested to transition multiple organisms from micro-scale through bench-scale into multi-kilo scale, advance the processes further into commercialization through contract manufacturing, spin-outs, sales and licensing, and have confidence and enthusiasm for the bio-based economy, as we have, you should apply.The ideal candidate is knowledgeable about microbial fermentation and process development and is used to work in bench-scale and 30-50L scale fermentation skids. You are fluent in cell physiology and strain development approaches. Metabolic engineers, molecular researchers, chemists and chemical engineers work hand in hand with you to fulfill the mission of the facility. Therefore we appreciate your skill to handle both metabolic as well as separation topics. You are responsible to develop the cell-factories towards commercial Key Performance Indicators inside the team and return guidance and feedback to the research and development staff of the Center.As a Senior Microbial Engineer, your position requires collaboration with internal research groups, the analytical and genome engineering group as well as with third parties, vendors, technology providers and engineering disciplines for process development. Also we ask you to drive the development across multiple organisms on the upstream (bio-reaction) side and assist more junior team members.Primary areas of responsibilitySupporting the transfer of cell factories, hosts and strains as well as bioprocesses through internal gate milestonesCollaborate with teams for performance mapping of micro-, small- and large-scale bio-reaction and verify specification demandsCollaborate with biochemists, metabolic and fermentation engineers to develop industrially robust fermentation and cultivation conditions for GMO cell-factoriesRunning, controlling and maintaining batch, fed-batch, repeated batch cultivations ideally for both bacteria and yeast, anaerobic and aerobicInterpreting data obtained during and after fermentation processes and develop KPIsInitiative and self-motivated with good planning & organizational skillsAbility to work simultaneously on different projectsExcellent collaboration & communication skills (English)Our expectations of youBSc./MSc. Degree (or similar) in Microbiology, Biotechnology, Biochemistry, Bioprocess Engineering or a related field with 5+ years relevant industrial experience – or a PhD. Degree of the same with 2+ years experienceMulti-Strain experience (bacterial, yeast, fungi) and strong on microbiology and physiology aspects of the organisms – focused on Fermentation and Cultivation skill, not genetic engineeringMindset to share your knowledge and experience with other disciplines and learn yourself from these.It would be great ifYou have expertise in scale down approaches (matching performance in microtiter plates to that in fermentation scale)You are from the Food, Feed, Chemicals or Life Sciences industry and applied production and manufacturing standardsYou have industrial expertise with scale-up of organisms larger than small pilot scale (>100L)You have experience with tech transfer of materials and processes to customers and/or contract manufacturing facilitiesYou have experience in organizing work with lab techniciansYou have hands on experience with Sartorius AMBR250 systemsWhat we offer in returnWe offer an interesting and challenging job in an international atmosphere with the focus on research, teaching, innovation and scientific advice for the benefit of the surrounding community. We place emphasis on a high level of professionalism among our staff, so skills development is an integral part of our organization. We offer a great flexibility in the position. In the area of technical and natural sciences, DTU is one of the leading research and education institutions in Europe.Salary and appointment termsThe appointment will be based on the collective agreement with the Confederation of Professional Associations. The allowance will be agreed with the relevant union.The place of employment is the DTU main campus in Lyngby, Denmark.The position is permanent.Application and contactPlease submit your online application no later than 30 April 2018.

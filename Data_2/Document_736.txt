[Science and Technology, Aarhus University Foulum, invites applications for a four-year Academic Employee position at the Department of Agroecology starting on 1st May 2018.Working areaThe Department of Agroecology is expanding its research into mitigation options for reducing nutrient losses from agricultural land to surface waters. The position will involve laboratory and fieldwork for monitoring solute transport and hydrological processes in relation to constructed systems, such as constructed wetlands, that remove nutrients from agricultural drainage waters. The successful candidate will take responsibility for upgrading and maintaining a database infrastructure related to tile drainage monitoring programmes. This includes initial analyses of hydraulic responses and nutrient flows in the monitored systems.The position is to strengthen ongoing activities at the department’s Soil Physics and Hydropedolgy Section. One challenge for intensive agriculture is to reduce its nutrient emissions and the ensuing adverse impact on the aquatic environment. In the future, the agricultural sector will have to comply with higher regulatory standards that involve targeted and emission-based approaches to mitigating nutrient losses from soil to water. This calls for an expanded research effort into effective mitigation options.The successful candidate will contribute directly to policy advice work the Department of Agroecology conducts for Danish authorities. The position will also involve technical supervision of graduate students within the area of mitigating agricultural nutrient losses using drainage filter technologies.Required qualifications

MSc degree in Environmental Engineering with specialization in nutrient transport or similar
Strong experience with management and maintenance of environmental databases
Expertise with experimental fieldwork related to hydraulic processes and nutrient transport
Ability to effectively work both independently and as part of a multi-disciplinary research team
A proven record of supporting the scientific publication process
Ability to contribute to research applicationsPlace of Work and area of EmploymentThe place of work is Blichers Allé 20, DK-8830 Tjele, and the area of employment is Aarhus University with related departments.Further information on the position may be obtained from project leader, Associate Professor Goswin Heckrath, phone +45 87157759, e-mail: Goswin.Heckrath@agro.au.dk (Goswin.Heckrath@agro.au.dk) or Section Manager Mogens H.

[Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research    Delineating common molecular networks involved in the lifespan and health promoting effects of dietary restriction and its mimetics    Tenure   Two years    Background   The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research (CBMR) has been established at the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen to conduct basic research on metabolism. CBMR consists of six scientific sections and a number of international research satellites, and was established through a DKK 885 million unrestricted grant from the Novo Nordisk Foundation. We are a center of excellence where talented researchers and experienced laboratory technicians is bringing scientific discoveries from the laboratory to the society in an effort to tackle some of today’s biggest challenges – diabetes and obesity. We are proud of the outstanding discoveries made by the Center, and we are committed to the translation of this knowledge into novel approaches to patient care. You can read more here http://cbmr.ku.dk/.    The position available is in Section for Integrative Physiology headed by Scientific Director Prof. Juleen Zierath and in the Group of Associate Prof. Jonas T. Treebak. The research aim in the group is to define the molecular and physiological mechanisms by which dietary compounds, weight loss and physical activity improve insulin sensitivity to prevent and treat T2D. We focus on interrogating the signaling pathways controlling cellular and whole body glucose and lipid homeostasis in cell-based and animal models. Functional genomics, metabolomics, and epigenetics-related methodologies are used to define the physiological role of novel and previously identified candidate genes/proteins linked to T2D and obesity. Detailed metabolic studies are performed to determine the genotype/phenotype interactions and to identify diabetes risk factors as well as mechanisms underlying development of insulin resistance.     Project Description  The project is based on an established collaboration between the Treebak laboratory and partners at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability, Danish Technical University and at the University of Campinas, Brazil. In this project, we aim to delineate the common molecular networks involved in the lifespan and health promoting effects of dietary restriction and its mimetics. To achieve this goal, we have designed a pipeline to determine biologically relevant pathways affected by these interventions. We will take advantage of the multidisciplinary expertise of the members of our team to explore the effects of specific dietary interventions in various animal models and in humans. We will analyze the metabolome, transcriptome, and miRNome of samples obtained from C. elegans, as well as adipose tissue and serum from mice and humans (healthy and/or type 2 diabetics) before and after dietary interventions. We will also perform metagenomics analyses of the gut microbiota of mice and humans since changes in the gut microbiome have been associated with the effects of DR. We will correlate these findings with lifespan and/or metabolic profiling using data integration through genome-scale modeling approaches in order to identify evolutionarily conserved pathways that are commonly affected by dietary treatments. The relevant pathways will then be scrutinized using gain- or loss-of-function models in C. elegans, mice and mammalian preadipocyte cell lines, providing new insights into how these dietary interventions affect health span in multiple organisms, including humans.    Qualifications   PhD in Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Molecular Biomedicine, or related sciences.       Highly motivated and an excellent team player.       Excellent scientific track record in relation to career stage.       Solid experience with mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analyses (targeted and/or untargeted approaches), including sample preparation, instrument handling, and data analyses.        Experience in the study of animal physiology, specifically related to in vivo and ex vivo metabolic studies using transgenic and knockout mouse models.       Experience with gain- or loss-of-function models in cells in culture (i.e., cell lines and/or primary cells).       Knowledge in proper experimental planning, power calculations, and statistical evaluation of experimental data.       Excellent English communication skills, both written and oral.        Employment Conditions   Salary and other terms and conditions of appointment are set in accordance with the Agreement between the Ministry of Finance and AC (Danish Confederation of Professional Associations) or other relevant professional organizations.

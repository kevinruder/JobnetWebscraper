[The Department of Bioscience, Aarhus University, invites applications for a position as Tenure-track Assistant Professor in Microbial Ecophysiology and Bioinformatics. The position is available from Oct 1, 2018, or as soon as possible thereafter, subject to negotiation.The Department of Bioscience The Department of Bioscience belongs to the Faculty of Science & Technology at Aarhus University. The Department currently employs approximately 140 full time scientific staff, 120 postdocs and PhD students and 120 technical support staff who together contribute to an international research environment. The research fields ranges most aspects of biology, spanning all biological levels from genes, physiological processes, individuals, populations and species to entire ecosystems. The Department is responsible for a Bachelor’s and a Master’s programme in Biology at Aarhus University. Further information may be found at http://bios.au.dk/en/ (http://bios.au.dk/en/).The selected candidate will join the Center for Electromicrobiology (CEM), a Danish National Research Foundation Center of Excellence (see http://cem.au.dk (http://cem.au.dk/)). The overarching research questions in CEM are how cable bacteria conduct electrons, how they handle metabolism based on widely separated oxidation and reduction processes and how they interact with other microorganisms and the environment. The Center is hosted at the Department of Bioscience as an independent unit on the main Aarhus University campus and shares the state-of-the-art laboratories, facilities and instruments with the Section for Microbiology, an internationally leading research group in microbial ecology and biogeochemistry where English is the preferred language (see http://bios.au.dk/om-instituttet/organisation/microbiology/ (http://bios.au.dk/om-instituttet/organisation/microbiology/)). The Center is also tapping into expertise and analytical facilites at the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics and the iNANO Center, Aarhus University, all within walking distance.Description of the positionWe are looking for an early career researcher with a strong scientific track record in microbiology research preferentially covering microbial ecophysiology and bioinformatics of both uncultured and cultured prokaryotes.
